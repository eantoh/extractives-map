Dashboard for mapping the extractive industries of Ghana

This project is an subset of the (Mapping for Results)[https://github.com/fortiusone/mapping-for-results] project that focuses on the extractives industry. This includes a lot of logic that handles mapping countries, extractives, government spending and more. The code could be easily streamlined to specific functionality just for the Extractive Industries.
